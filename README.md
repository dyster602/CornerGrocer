## Project Summary
This project is a C++ application created to help a small grocery store track item purchases. The program reads data from an input file, counts how often each item appears, and allows the user to view this information through a menu-driven interface. Users can search for specific items, display all item frequencies, or view the data as a text-based histogram.

## What I Did Well
I did a good job organizing the program into logical components using classes and functions. Separating file input, data processing, and output made the code easier to read and maintain. I also focused on keeping the menu system clear and easy to navigate for the user.

## Areas for Improvement
If I were to improve this project, I would add stronger input validation and error handling. This would help prevent unexpected input from causing issues and would make the program more reliable and secure overall.

## Challenges and How I Overcame Them
The most challenging part of this project was working with file input/output and maintaining accurate frequency counts. I overcame this by breaking the problem into smaller steps, testing each part individually, and using debugging tools and course resources to identify and fix issues.

## Transferable Skills
This project helped me develop transferable skills such as problem decomposition, debugging, file handling, and writing readable and maintainable code. These skills will be useful in future coursework and real-world programming projects.

## Maintainability and Readability
I focused on maintainability by using clear variable names, comments, and consistent formatting. Organizing the code into functions and classes makes it easier to update, reuse, or expand in the future.
